Development on this module will start after the publication of the QSD introductory manuscript [1]_.


Summary
-------
This module will walk you through the QSD methodology - what it is and how it can be used in practice to guide the research, development, and deployment of technologies (RD&D) and inform decision-making.

**Learning objectives:**
	- Understand the concept of QSD and steps for application.
	- Describe, differentiate, and give examples of key terminologies (e.g., decision variables, sustainability indicators).
	- For a given system, identify potential decision variables, technological parameters, and contextual parameters, and qualitatively describe how QSD can be applied to guide the RD&D of this system and evaluate tradeoffs in decision-making.

**Sub-modules:**
	- A1: Overview of the QSD methodology
	- A2: Construct problem space
	- A3: Establish simulation algorithms
	- A4: Characterize system sustainability
	- A5: Execution and applications
