27th Environmental Engineering and Science Symposium
====================================================

This repository contains materials initially developed for a QSDsan workshop on April 22, 2022 during the `27th Environmental Engineering and Science (EES) Symposium <https://publish.illinois.edu/2022-environmentalsymposium>`_ and updated for later workshops. You can find the `recording <https://youtu.be/C4Wk2bhsvnk>`_ of the EES Symposium workshop and a `demo video <https://youtu.be/cO3LZpwOit8>`_ at our YouTube channel. Slides used for this workshop can be viewed and downloaded through `this link <https://uofi.box.com/s/ysjoo1dfmddrhkdp8xttmlggaa9k9ubl>`_.

**Materials includes:**
* Jupyter Notebook examples (see below on how to run these notebooks interactively in your browser)
    - Example_complete.ipynb (fully populated with additional notes)
    - Example_interactive.ipynb (interactive module that does not require any coding skills)
* Python modules to construct the systems and analyses, including:
    - country_specific.py (country-specific analysis)
    - models.py (uncertainty and sensitivity analyses)
    - systems.py (systems)
* data folder with data used in the analysis (e.g., location-specific parameters)
* results folder with results generated from the analysis
* repository organizing and configuration files (``files`` folder, README.md, runtime.txt, etc.)
