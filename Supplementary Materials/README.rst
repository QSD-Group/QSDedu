Summary
-------
This module provides compiled resources for **beginners** (pros, you may know different and better ways, in which case we welcome contributions and suggestions!) to learn Python and package development. Basic knowledge on Python is required to use QSD packages, and advanced skills on version control software (e.g., Git/GitHub), documentation tools (e.g., Sphinx), and shell (e.g., bash) may be needed for package development.

**Note:**
Many of the materials provided here are not step-by-step instructions to complete certain tasks, rather, they are the compilation of links to resources. They might not answer all of your questions, in which case search engine and platforms such as `stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/>`_ would be of great help.

Of couse, you can also submit a `GitHub issue <https://github.com/yalinli2/EDUxQSD/issues>`_ for this repository and we will try out best to answer your questions.
